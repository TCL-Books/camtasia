Installing Camtasia
====================

Camtasia is commercial software. To work with the program you need to buy a license and activate it after installation.

Before purchasing you can download a trial version of the program to test all the features and functions available in Camtasia. The evaluation version is valid for 30 days, after which you will need to install a license to continue working with the program.

.. note::
  **Creating an account for the trial version**

  To use the trial version of Camtasia, you must create an account on the TechSmith website. When creating an account, you need to provide an email address and a password. You can do this after installing the program.

To install the program, follow these steps:

#. Select the language in which to install the program. At the moment Russian is not supported in the installation program, so we choose the Eng-lish language.
