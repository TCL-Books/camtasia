Activating Camtasia
====================

When Camtasia is installed, the program shortcut is added to the Windows start menu (**Start** - **TechSmith** - **Camtasia**) and to the desktop (if you haven't changed the default settings during the installation). To start Camtasia, double-click the shortcut or select the corresponding entry in the start menu. The program activation window is shown.

Here you can either enter your existing license (**Enter Software Key**) or select the option to use the trial version (**Sign In to Start Trial**). The test version is valid for 30 days and has the same set of features as the activated version of the program. The only limitation is the display of the watermark on the created video material.
